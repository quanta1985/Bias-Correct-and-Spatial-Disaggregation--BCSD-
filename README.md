# Bias Correct and Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD)
This is the Bias-Correct and Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) program for downscaling daily near surface temperature (tas), maximum daily temeprature (tasmax), and mininum daily temperature (tasmin) and precipitation data. The orginial method by Wood et al (2004) can be found here: https://doi.org/10.1023/B:CLIM.0000013685.99609.9e
Usage note and guidelines:
1. The BCSD downscaling program for temperature and precipitation are different. Precipitation downscaling is separate with temperature downscaling and can be executed individually. Temperature downscaling program requires both tas, tasmax, and tasmin.
